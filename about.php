    <h4><b>1.Vision and Mission</b><br/><br/>

Start your About Us page by telling your customers about yourself. What is unique about you, what are your key features and what is your mission? Try to stand out by conveying your values and culture as a brand, or what brought your company together. Use this area to fully answer the question of who you are as a brand, and what you represent. This doesnâ€™t mean that it has to be overly lengthy, but you can use this space to communicate yourself in the way you are comfortable with, with your audience.<br/><br/>
<b>2.Your History</b><br/> <br/>
Take the visitors on your website to a trip down memory lane, and give them an insight to the history behind your store. Here, you can show them where, how, and when you started, and everything your business has accomplished on the way. This is your chance to share your relevant milestones and achievements relating to your business in an engaging way. You can even choose to present your history to your viewers in the form of a timeline, which allows you to display a large amount of information in a visually engaging manner. Your customers or potential customers might be interested in seeing how you grew over the years.<br/><br/>
<b>3.Team Member Profiles</b><br/> <br/>
Add an emotional element to your About Us page by adding details of the people that are driving the passion at your business. People find it easier to connect with human beings, so allow the personality of your crew to shine through the About Us page.<br/><br/>
<b>4.Multimedia & Infographics</b><br/> <br/>
A well-built infographic might help visitors remember about you or your business better than any amount of words. So if you think it works better for your brand or business, skip the lengthy description, or add a well-designed graphic that can help your visitors understand your concept. Or maybe you would like to add a cool video about how your business was created, or about your story and let it speak for itself.<h4><br/>
